A public log of intuitive remote viewing sessions verified by SHA-256 hash. All entries timestamped and validated using ChatGPT and independent hash verification.
# Remote Viewing Log with ChatGPT Ai

This public log documents a series of remote viewing sessions verified by SHA-256 hashes.  
Each entry includes the intuitive target impression, the corresponding hash, and proof of alignment with a pre-locked target word.

All sessions were conducted double-blind and verified using hash-matching tools such as [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) and [SHA256 generators](https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/).

> Timestamps reflect the moment each impression was submitted before revealing the target hash.

## ðŸ”’ Method

1. A target word is chosen and hashed using SHA-256.
2. The viewer intuits the target (without knowing the word).
3. The viewer reveals their impression.
4. If the hash of their impression matches the original, the session is confirmed.
5. All hashes are timestamped and stored here for public audit.
